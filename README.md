## Motivation

This is the first project I made with my team. The project using ExpressJS, NodeJS and Handlebars to build website. In the lack of review movies website, we see that problems and started making this project. We hope that this project will help you to find the best movies to watch.

## Installation

First time you see this repository, you must clone it and then run the following command:

### `npm install`

Moreover, you should have a backend which is running with ExpressJS and NodeJS. You should also have your database to run successfully:

-   **create database review_db**

Next, you will create an .env file in your repository. The .env will follow this

-   **DB_NAME**
-   **DB_USERNAME**
-   **DB_PASSWORD**
-   **DB_HOST**
-   **DB_PORT**
-   **SESSION_SECRET**
-   **CLIENT_ID**
-   **CLIENT_SECRET**
-   **REDIRECT_URI**
-   **REFRESH_TOKEN**

After all the configuration, you can run the following command:

### `npm run dev`

And... That's all what you need.

## Requirements

-   **nodejs >=14**
